# Progress - [Implementing Model Type Selection]

## Chunk Overview

- **Description**: Implemented model type selection and updated services to use different models based on configuration.
- **Milestone**: Enhanced flexibility in model selection for different performance needs.

## Tasks

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Task 1**: Add model_type configuration to config.go
  - Notes: Added "model_type" field to AppConfig struct with options "fast", "normal", or "accurate"
- [x] **Task 2**: Update service_factory.go to pass model_type to service constructors
  - Notes: Modified GetService method to include model_type in service initialization
- [x] **Task 3**: Implement model selection in OpenAIService
  - Notes: Added getModel method to select appropriate model based on model_type
- [x] **Task 4**: Implement model selection in ClaudeService
  - Notes: Added getModel method to select appropriate model based on model_type
- [x] **Task 5**: Update MockImageAnalysisService to include model_type
  - Notes: Added ModelType field and included it in mock responses
- [x] **Task 6**: Implement AnalyzeFoodText method for text-only analysis
  - Notes: Added new method to all services for analyzing food without images

### In-Progress Tasks

- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement model selection in LLAMAService
  - Status: To Do
  - Notes: Need to research available LLAMA models for different performance levels

### Pending Tasks

- [ ] **Task 8**: Update API documentation to reflect model type selection
- [ ] **Task 9**: Add unit tests for model type selection in each service

## Issues and Blockers

- **Issue 1**: LLAMA service implementation is incomplete
  - Action Items: Research LLAMA models and implement model selection

## Notes

- **General Observations**: The implementation of model type selection has been smooth for OpenAI and Claude services. The mock service now includes model type information, which will be useful for testing. We've also added support for text-only analysis across all services.
- **Adjustments**: We may need to revisit the OpenAI model selection once more information about their model capabilities is available.
