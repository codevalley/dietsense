# Todo List

## Technical Debt

1. **API Key Authentication Middleware**

   - **Description**: Implement middleware to authenticate requests using API keys.
   - **Impact**: Currently, the API endpoints are not secured by API keys, which is a security risk.
   - **Action**: Develop authentication middleware and apply it to the necessary routes.

2. **Rate Limiting Implementation**

   - **Description**: Enforce rate limits per API key to prevent abuse.
   - **Impact**: Without rate limiting, the service is vulnerable to excessive use, leading to increased costs and degraded performance.
   - **Action**: Integrate a rate-limiting solution like `go-redis-rate`.

3. **Error Handling and Input Validation**

   - **Description**: Improve error messages and input validation across the API.
   - **Impact**: Enhances user experience and reduces potential for unexpected behavior.
   - **Action**: Use validation libraries and implement centralized error handling.

4. **Database Schema Updates**

   - **Description**: Review and update database schemas for consistency and efficiency.
   - **Impact**: Optimizes database performance and maintainability.
   - **Action**: Refactor models and migration scripts as needed.

5. **Logging Improvements**

   - **Description**: Enhance logging to include more context and handle log rotation.
   - **Impact**: Improves monitoring and debugging capabilities.
   - **Action**: Adjust logging configurations and consider using a logging aggregation service.

6. **Test Coverage**

   - **Description**: Increase unit and integration test coverage.
   - **Impact**: Ensures code reliability and facilitates future changes.
   - **Action**: Write additional tests for critical components.

7. **Configuration Management**

   - **Description**: Secure handling of configuration files and secrets.
   - **Impact**: Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information.
   - **Action**: Use environment variables or a secrets management system.
